# Snapshot testing

Summary

1. Snapshot can be used for base components from our component design (such as Text, Textfield, Button, MenuItem, etc)

   - Because it could affect the whole app. For me it could be a signal to tell I should be more focus on review that part

2. When build a complex components with component from base components, snapshot become unreliable => should not be used
   - Hard and lazy to detect change
   - Should focus more on behavior testing
